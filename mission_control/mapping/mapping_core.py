"""Dual-layer occupancy-grid mapping core.

Pure logic, no FastAPI/Redis/robot-client imports, so it is directly unit
testable: everything here takes/returns plain dataclasses and lists.

Two layers per grid cell:
  - floor  (traversability): log-odds occupancy grid, exposed as
    -1 unknown / 0 free / 100 occupied per CONVENTIONS.md's map schema.
  - walls  (vertical-obstacle height): 0..255, bucketed from LiDAR point
    height (z). Updated independently of the floor decision so a low
    curb and a floor-to-ceiling wall are distinguishable even though both
    may register as "occupied" on the floor layer.

Multi-level (stairs) support: since the wire schema (CONVENTIONS.md) has a
single top-level ``level_id`` per map, cells belonging to a different floor
are kept in a *separate* OccupancyGrid instead of being mixed into one grid
under a per-cell level field. ``MapStore`` holds one grid per detected
level and exposes the currently active one -- see mapping/app.py.
